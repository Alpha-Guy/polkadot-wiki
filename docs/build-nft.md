# Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

## Fungibility

If we both have one DOT token, and, for example sake, we decided to trade them with eachother, 
we would both still hold a token that represents the same good and value as our original DOT token,
because the DOT token is considered to be a fungible commodity; this would hold true for all DOT tokens in circulation. 

Fungibility is a principle in economics that serves as a property for a good or commodity, where 
that good or commodity is deemed to be interchangeable and indistinguishable of the same type.
This suggests that if we both have a good or commodity of the same type [that holds the property of 
fungibility], then, we have the exact same good or commodity with *equal value*.

The best example to keep in mind is the exchange of a modern-day currency: currencies hold the property of fungibility as each individual unit of that currecny (e.g. USD, EUR, YEN) is interchangeable with one another, and thus, indistinguishable.

## Non-Fungible

This could only mean one thing, a non-fungible good or commodity is one that does not hold the property
of fungibility, which, in turn, cannot be interchangeable and indistinguishable.

## NFTs

NFTs allow us to tokenize unique items and provide ownership for those tokens.
